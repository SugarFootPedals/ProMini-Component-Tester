Code is working.

added code to display the word "ohm" on the OLED instead of using the Greek symbol for Omega.
also using lower-case "u" in place of Greek symbol Mu for micro, as neither of the symbols are included in the Adafruit GFX Library default font for SSD1306 OLED Displays.

added code to display schematic symbols for Capacitor ("-||-"), Resistor ("-[//]-"),
and Diode (" C-|<-A" or "A->|-C") dependent on which way the diode is facing. 
Inductors use the same symbol for Resistor.

to do:

Clean up code to remove everything unnecessary for use with a ProMini (ATmega328) and OLED display.
